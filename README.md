# Tic-Tac-Toe-Server
Backend part of My multiplayer tic tac toe game in java. Main technology\
used to build this project is **spring**. Additionally, I have created\
game [client](https://github.com/maciejplis/Tic-Tac-Toe-Client) in **angular**.

You can see LIVE version [here](https://beautiful-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com)!

## Motivation
Main goal of this project is to expand my knowledge of spring\
and other java-related technologies, also I desire to learn how\
to properly test, document and organize slightly bigger program.\
Apart from that I hope to master more design patterns and write \
cleaner code.
